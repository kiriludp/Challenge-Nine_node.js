  ## Description
    This is a generator that provides the framework and foundation for the creation of a professional, detailed README applicable for any project.

  ## Usage
    To allow for standardized parameters for developers and the READMEs for multiple projects. The application removes the need to re-write all details of a README and instead, allows for the user to change only the details based on each project.
    
  ## Learn
    The devil is in the details-- it is imparative that each detail in the coding framework is correctly connected to the next. Understanding potential errors that could arise in each test is  the only solution to actually fixing  problems. 

  ## Steps
    users must have npm inquirer@8.2.4 installed in order to use this generator.

  ## Features
    The details of the README can be changed to include not only the detailed areas, but also the information to include such as contact details, links, etc.

  ## Tests
    testReadMe included-- please see screen shots and included video.
